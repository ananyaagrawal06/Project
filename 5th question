create another shell script that automates the backup of important files and directories to a backup location. The script should:
1.	Take inputs:
o	The source directory (which files and directories to back up).
o	The destination directory (where the backup should be saved).
o	An optional flag for compressing the backup into a .tar.gz file.
2.	Check for errors:
o	Ensure that the source directory exists.
o	Ensure that the destination directory exists (if it doesn't, the script should create it).
3.	Backup process:
o	If the compress flag is provided, the backup should be a compressed .tar.gz archive.
o	If the compress flag is not provided, the script should simply copy the files to the destination directory.
4.	Logging:
o	Create a log file where the script writes the success or failure of each backup operation, along with a timestamp.


5.	Cleanup:
o	If the backup was successful, remove any backups older than 7 days in the destination directory.
